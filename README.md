Here's a basic example of how to use xsql. Open your preferred text editor and write the following code:

```go
package main

import (
    "database/sql"
    "github.com/go-mizu/xsql"
    _ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"
)

func main() {
    db, err := sql.Open("mysql", "user:password@/dbname")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    defer db.Close()

    var name string
    err = xsql.Select("SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = ?", 1).Scan(&name)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    println(name)
}
```

This code connects to a MySQL database and retrieves a name from a user table. Replace `user:password@/dbname` with your actual database credentials.
